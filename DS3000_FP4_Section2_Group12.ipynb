    " Have you ever wondered what is the best way to get from Mission Hill to Northeastern campus and vice versa? When you’re in a rush calculating the time and cost of different transportation types can be tedious. Our goal is to find an answer to the best transportation type in terms of speed and cost. We will be looking at MBTA, Uber, and Bluebikes. We will be comparing the average time and cost it takes people to make it from Mission Hill to Northeastern and vice versa. Our datasets are pulled from the different transportation types websites. The data includes the time it takes to complete trips, so for Uber the time from pickup to drop off, Bluebikes it’s time for a rider to go from one station to another, and for MBTA Roxbury Crossing to Ruggles and Brigham Circle to Northeastern. Bluebikes and Uber also have the cost of each trip. MBTA and Bluebikes also have the option for a fixed cost ride structure where you can pay one price for the whole trip or use a monthly or yearly pass. We plan to measure from a point on campus to a point on Mission Hill. We will take into account average / estimated walking speeds from a station to the point.\n"
